# Zoom Jira Connector

A quick and dirty API written in about 2 hours, that allows Automate For Jira's outgoing webhook action to create a Zoom meeting and then append the meeting URL back on the issue in Jira.


You need:

* Zoom API key
* Zoom API secret
* Automate for Jira
* Normal web server stuff you would use to run any other Laravel project.
